  An *application* node_modules directory may be used to effectively remove
  relative paths in source files when referencing to the application
  sub-modules.

The `node_modules` folder contains, most of the time, the project dependencies that it needs to work. The `src` folder is then used to hold the source code of the application which oftentimes is compiled down to a compatible ECMAScript version into `dist` or `build` folders.

When the source folder contains the sub-modules of the application, references to them start to spring in the form of relative paths with a series of `..` before the actual module. This relative paths become unmanageable rather quickly as they are not tolerant to directory restructuring.

To solve this problem some bundlers support the concept of `aliases` which allow a symbol to be used as a kind of absolute reference relative to the configured base directory. Another strategy is to define `NODE_PATH` to be the project's `src` directory.

The strategy explored in this article takes advantage of the way  modules are resolved by `nodejs`, that is check the path to the current directory in reverse order.

By creating a `node_modules` directory inside the project's `src` other files may use the sub-modules without any prefix, just as project dependencies are referenced. **In essence, an application `node_modules` folder**.

Let's review how the directory structure of such a project could look like:

```
  project-root
  ├── node_modules
  ├── package.json
  └── src
      ├── node_modules
      │    └── project-name
      │        ├── module-a
      │        └── module-b
      └── index.js
```

The `project-name` folder creates a namespace of modules that helps avoiding conflicts with released packages which would be installed inside the `node_modules` under `project-root`.

With this project setup `index.js` or other files under the `src` folder may reference sub-modules in a very natural way:

```
const a = require('project-name/module-a')
```
